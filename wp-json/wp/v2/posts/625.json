The most common work visas include the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and the International Mobility Program (IMP). Each program has its own set of criteria and application processes.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)<\/strong> is designed to fill labour shortages in Canada by allowing employers to hire foreign workers temporarily. To qualify, the employer must obtain a Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), which demonstrates that there is a need for a foreign worker and that no Canadian citizen or permanent resident is available to do the job. The foreign worker must also meet the job requirements and obtain a work permit.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>International Mobility Program (IMP)<\/strong> allows employers to hire foreign workers without the need for an LMIA. This program includes various categories, such as the Intra-Company Transfer, which enables multinational companies to transfer employees to their Canadian branches, and the Global Talent Stream, which targets highly skilled workers in the tech industry. To qualify, the foreign worker must meet the specific criteria of the IMP category and obtain a work permit.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these programs, there are other pathways for skilled workers, such as the <strong>Express Entry system<\/strong>. This system manages applications for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the Federal Skilled Trades Program, and the Canadian Experience Class. Candidates are assessed based on factors such as age,<\/p>\n<p>Education, work experience, and language proficiency. Those with the highest scores are invited to apply for permanent residence.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\"><strong><em>APPLY NOW<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/kikabu.com.ng\/how-to-get-civil-engineering-internship-opportunities-in-canada\/\">Civil Engineering Internship Opportunities in Canada with Visa Sponsorship<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/kikabu.com.ng\/best-places-to-work-in-canada-for-students\/\">Best Places to Work in Canada for Students<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Application Requirements and Documents<\/h2>\n<p>When applying for jobs in Canada, immigrants must prepare a set of documents to support their applications.
