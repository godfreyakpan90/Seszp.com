Best of all, many of these groups provide cash assistance to first-time buyers. <\/p>\n<p>If you qualify, you could end up with thousands in loans or grants to help with your down payment and closing costs.

These are meant to promote affordable housing for first-time buyers in PA.<\/p>\n<p>Pennsylvania first-time home buyers may also be able to get a mortgage credit certificate (MCC) from the PHFA. An MCC is a tax credit that reduces the amount of federal income tax you have to pay. This frees up more income to qualify for a home loan and afford your monthly payments.<\/p>\n<p>PHFA also offers free home buyer education and counseling through one of its approved counseling agencies. If your credit score is less than 680, it requires an in-person course to use one of its mortgage programs.<\/p>\n<p><span>Verify your home buying eligibility in PA. Start here<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"hfa-preferred-lo-mi\">HFA Preferred (Lo MI)<\/h3>\n<p>The HFA Preferred is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with flexible underwriting guidelines and a 3% down payment requirement. It also provides mortgage insurance at below-market rates for borrowers with less than 20% down. One distinctive feature of this loan program is that mortgage repayments are made to the PHFA rather than your lender.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"keystone-home-loan-program\">Keystone Home Loan Program <\/h3>\n<p>First-time home buyers, veterans, and buyers in specific Pennsylvania counties can finance their home purchase with a conventional loan or one of the government-backed mortgages: FHA, VA, or USDA. You\u2019ll need to meet the program\u2019s purchase price and income limits.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"keystone-government-loan-k-gov\">Keystone Government Loan (K-Gov)<\/h3>\n<p>Borrowers who want a government-backed loan to pay for a home purchase may find that the K-Gov has more flexible underwriting rules. This PHFA program may have less stringent requirements for qualified buyers. However, you must speak with a participating lender to determine your eligibility.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"phfa-eligibility-requirements\">PHFA eligibility requirements<\/h3>\n<p>To obtain a mortgage through this organization, you must select a private company from its approved lender list. Furthermore, some of its programs have income limits, home purchase price caps, and minimum credit score requirements. The PHFA website has more information about its homeownership assistance programs.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"pa-first-time-home-buyer-grants\">PA first-time home buyer grants<\/h2>\n<p>The PHFA offers a number of appealing down payment and closing cost assistance programs for Pennsylvania first-time home buyers. However, these are usually forgivable loans rather than outright grants. Each of these programs has its own set of eligibility requirements and restrictions. So, go to the PHFA website and look for an assistance program that is well-suited to your financial situation.<\/p>\n<p><span>Let us help find the right mortgage for you. Start here<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"keystone-forgivable-in-ten-years-loan-program-k-fit\">Keystone Forgivable in Ten Years Loan Program (K-FIT)<\/h3>\n<p>You can borrow up to 5% of the home\u2019s market or appraised value, whichever is lower. However, the terms of this loan are unique: 10% of the loan is forgiven annually. If you move after the first year, you must repay 90% of the amount you borrowed. But if you\u2019re still living in your primary residence after 10 years, you won\u2019t owe anything.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify, you must have a credit score of 660 and less than $50,000 in liquid assets. The K-FIT loan program may be used on Conventional, FHA, VA or RD loans.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"keystone-advantage-assistance-loan-program\">Keystone Advantage Assistance Loan Program<\/h3>\n<p>This housing assistance program provides an interest-free second mortgage that must be repaid over ten years. It allows you to borrow up to 4% of the market or appraised value of your home, whichever is less. But the total you can borrow is capped at $6,000.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"homestead-down-payment-and-closing-cost-assistance-loan\">HOMEstead Down Payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan<\/h3>\n<p>The PHFA\u2019s HOMEstead program is yet another excellent offering. This allows you to borrow up to $10,000 as a no-interest second mortgage loan. <\/p>\n<p>The HOMEstead loan, like the K-FIT, is forgiven year by year over a specified time period. That\u2019s only five years in this case. As a result, even if you make no payments, your loan amount decreases by 20% each year. If you keep the house as your primary residence for five years, your loan will be completely forgiven at the end of that period.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"access-down-payment-and-closing-cost-assistance-program\">Access Down Payment and Closing Cost Assistance Program<\/h3>\n<p>Home buyers with disabilities or disabled family members may be eligible for funding to cover the cost of accessibility modifications, as well as a no-interest loan of up to $15,000 for down payment and closing cost assistance. <\/p>\n<p>You must meet household income limits. This program cannot be combined with any other PHFA down payment assistance program.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"first-front-door-program\">First Front Door Program <\/h3>\n<p>First Front Door (FFD) can help you with closing costs and down payment. For every $1 you contribute, FFD will provide $3 in assistance, up to $5,000. The loan is forgiven if the property is not sold prior to five years, but is not forgiven if sold prior to five years. <\/p>\n<p><span\/><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"pennsylvania-first-time-home-buyer-key-stats\">Pennsylvania first-time home buyer key stats<\/h2>\n<p>The median sales price for homes in Pennsylvania was $263,700 in February 2024, according to Redfin. That increased 8.2% year-over-year.<\/p>\n<p>Many Pennsylvania first-time home buyers face a real estate market with limited inventory and rising price inflation. However, there is still hope for new homeowners in the Keystone State. You might be eligible for one of several homeownership programs that can get you into a home sooner than you think. <\/p>\n<p><span>Verify your home buying eligibility in PA.

The good news is that you don\u2019t need that much. Not by a long shot.<\/p>\n<p><span>Find the best first-time home buyer loan for you. Start here<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Borrowers can often get into a new home with as little as 3% or even 0% down using one of these low-down-payment mortgage programs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Conventional 97<\/strong><\/span>: From Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. 3% down payment and 620 minimum FICO score. You can usually stop paying mortgage insurance after a few years<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">FHA loan<\/span><\/strong>: Backed by the Federal Housing Administration. 3.5% down and a 580 minimum credit score. But you\u2019re on the hook for mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) until you refinance to a different type of mortgage, move, or pay off your loan<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">VA loan<\/span><\/strong>: Only for veterans and service members. Zero down payment is required. Minimum credit score varies by lender but often 620. No ongoing mortgage insurance after closing. These are arguably the best mortgages available, so apply if you\u2019re eligible<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">USDA loan<\/span><\/strong>: For those on low-to-moderate incomes buying in designated rural areas (so high-density populations like Philadelphia and Delaware counties rarely qualify). Zero down payment required. Credit score requirements vary by lender but often 640. Low mortgage insurance rates<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency loans<\/strong>: May include competitive interest rates and down payment assistance. More information below<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that government loan programs (including FHA, VA, and USDA home loans) require you to buy a primary residence. That means you can\u2019t use these loans for a vacation home or investment property.<\/p>\n<p>Most programs for Pennsylvania first-time home buyers allow gifted money or down payment assistance (DPA) to cover the down payment and closing costs. Depending on the mortgage loan you choose, you could potentially get into your new house with minimal cash out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure which program to choose for your first mortgage loan, your lender or real estate agent can help you find the right match based on your finances and home-buying goals.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"buying-a-home-in-pennsylvanias-major-cities\">Buying a home in Pennsylvania\u2019s major cities<\/h2>\n<p>Home price growth in Philadelphia has been tepid recently. This can be good news for first-time buyers. But if you\u2019re hoping to purchase real estate in Pittsburgh or Allentown, be prepared for soaring home prices. <\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, housing costs in Pennsylvania\u2019s three biggest cities are higher than the statewide average.
