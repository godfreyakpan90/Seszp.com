(SNAP) and Tripadvisor, Inc.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong> (TRIP), to determine which has better upside potential. Based on a fundamental comparison of these stocks, I find TRIP to be a better pick for the reasons explained throughout this article.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">The internet industry is a fundamental cornerstone of today&#8217;s information society, linking billions of people worldwide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Moreover, governmental efforts to enhance internet accessibility contribute to the industry&#8217;s growth. The BEAD program, under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), dedicates over $42 billion to improve nationwide high-speed internet access, including in various U.S. territories.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Furthermore, the internet travel industry is experiencing expansion fueled by traveler preferences for dependable transportation, tailored services, and group excursions, particularly among younger demographics. The worldwide online travel booking services market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9% until 2030.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Both the company exceeded consensus EPS estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. While TRIP surpassed consensus revenue estimates, SNAP failed to do so in the same quarter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">When it comes to price performance, TRIP is the clear winner. Over the past nine months, TRIP\u2019s stock has gained 64.2%, compared to SNAP\u2019s 7.2% decline. TRIP has returned 39.6% over the past year, compared to SNAP\u2019s marginal decline.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Here are the reasons I think TRIP could perform better in the near term:<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Latest Developments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">On March 26, SNAP and Integral Ad Science (IAS) announced a pioneering partnership to enhance transparency for advertisers on SNAP campaigns using IAS&#8217;s AI-powered Total Media Quality (TMQ) Brand Safety and Suitability Measurement product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">On the other hand, on February 12, TRIP announced the formation of a Special Committee to evaluate potential transactions. The committee, comprising independent directors, has engaged Centerview Partners LLC as its financial advisor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Recent Financial Results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">SNAP\u2019s revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, declined marginally year-over-year to $4.61 million. Its free cash flow decreased 37.1% year-over-year to $34.79 million. Additionally, its non-GAAP net income fell 48.1% and 47.1% year-over-year to $144.13 million and $0.09 per share.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">In contrast, in the fiscal year that ended December 31, 2023, TRIP\u2019s revenue rose 19.8% year-over-year to $1.79 billion. Its adjusted net income improved 70.6% and 72% year-over-year to $186 million and $1.29 per share.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Expected Financial Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Street estimates SNAP\u2019s revenue and EPS to rise 13.7% and 98.6% year-over-year to $5.23 billion and $0.18 in the fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal first quarter, SNAP is expected to report a loss per share of $0.05, and its revenue is likely to rise 13.4% year-over-year to $1.12 billion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Conversely, analysts expect SNAP\u2019s EPS and revenue for fiscal year 2024 to decline 19.3% and 8.8% year-over-year to $1.54 and $1.94 billion, respectively<strong>. <\/strong>For the fiscal first quarter, TRIP is expected to report an EPS of $0.05, and its revenue is likely to rise 6% year-over-year to $393.39 million.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Profitability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">TRIP is more profitable, with a trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 91.67%, higher than SNAP\u2019s 54.10%. TRIP\u2019s trailing-12-month EBIT margin of 8.28% compares to SNAP\u2019s negative 30.36%. Moreover, SNAP\u2019s trailing-12-month asset turnover ratio of 0.58x is lower than TRIP\u2019s 0.70x.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Valuation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">In terms of forward EV\/Sales, TRIP is currently trading at 1.88x, lower than SNAP\u2019s 3.67x. TRIP\u2019s forward P\/S of 1.96x is lower than SNAP\u2019s 3.52x.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Thus, TRIP is relatively more affordable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong>POWR Ratings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"\">SNAP has an overall rating of D, which equates to Sell in our proprietary\u00a0POWR Ratings\u00a0system. TRIP has an overall rating of B, which translates to Buy. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Our proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">SNAP has a D grade for Quality, consistent with its poor profitability. Its trailing-12-month leveraged FCF margin of 4.38% is 47.3% lower than the industry average of 8.31%. Its trailing-12-month negative ROTC of 12.93% compares to the 3.31% industry average.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">On the other hand, TRIP has an A grade for Quality, in sync with the company\u2019s high profitability. Its trailing-12-month leveraged FCF margin and ROTC of 13.81% and 5.18% are 66.3% and 56.2% higher than the industry averages of 8.31% and 3.31%.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Of the 53 stocks in the\u00a0Internet\u00a0industry, SNAP is ranked #52, while TRIP is ranked #5 in the same industry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">Beyond what we\u2019ve stated above, we have also rated both stocks for Growth, Momentum, Stability, Value, and Sentiment.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to view SNAP\u2019s ratings.

Internet companies are benefiting strongly from this growing usage. In the Internet sector, both SNAP and TRIP stand out as significant contenders for long-term investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">However, after analyzing revenue growth, profitability, and recent initiatives, a compelling case emerges for TRIP as the favored investment option.
