(WETM) \u2013 \u201cHearts and emotions are very much heightened and I understand that. These are our friends, these are our neighbors, these are our community members.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On April 4, a large number of concerned parents, teachers and community members attended the Horseheads School District budget workshop.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed budget would cut an estimated 49 positions and funding to some extracurricular activities. Many people spoke out against those cuts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest concern about losing my position is what\u2019s going to happen to the children of the horseheads community,\u201d said one teacher.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou take away our nurses, our teacher aides. Like, that is all going to affect our kids and fall into our laps again,\u201d said another teacher.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI truly believe we need to make those positions a priority and protect our most vulnerable students. Our students with special needs,\u201d said a special needs teacher.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab\">\n<\/aside>\n<p>Superintendent Dr. Thomas Douglas says these cuts are due to a multitude of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the end of a pandemic. With the renegotiation of healthcare contracts outside of the district, not with us that has chosen to show itself of almost a $4 million plus increase in healthcare alone. Not to mention the other inflationary impacts,\u201d said Douglas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He also says the district has exhausted its options to lower a three million dollar deficit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to start notifying unfortunately staff that potential jobs could be in jeopardy. But even during that time, we are tonight showing what potential reductions would need to be made in the district to balance the gap, which we\u2019re obligated to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab\">\n<\/aside>\n<p>Douglas says the community has the power to make a change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, only the community sets the direction for the district. The board can sit there and say we\u2019re going at two percent. The board can sit there and say we don\u2019t want to make these cuts or we\u2019ve made some cuts. We want to challenge or the board can say we don\u2019t think the community will support it and we want to go below; which means we may have to make more reductions,\u201d said Douglas.<\/p>\n<p>No decision will be made on these budget cuts until the tentative date of April 18.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HORSEHEADS, N.Y.
