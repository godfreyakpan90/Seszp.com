In a recent reel shared on her social media account, Mohmedi showcased her talent by creating Heihei, the beloved rooster character from Disney&#8217;s Moana.<\/p>\n<p>The <span>viral video<\/span> captures her creative process as she arranges fresh herbs, thinly sliced carrots, mushrooms, noodles, boiled eggs, red bell peppers, and other ingredients onto an empty plate, transforming them into the recognisable likeness of Heihei. To complete the masterpiece, Mohmedi adds a finishing touch by pouring hot broth in the background, adding depth and texture to her culinary creation.<\/p>\n<p>Many users took to the comments section to appreciate this <span>food art<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My three-year-old is obsessed with this video. He asked to watch it all the time,&#8221; an Instagram user wrote, and another added, &#8220;Oh my&#8230;he is way too cute to eat!&#8221; A user wrote, &#8220;Every time you place that first ingredient down, I try and guess what you are up to! I love this,&#8221; and another added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I ended up here, but I&#8217;m glad I did! Thank you, algorithm!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On Laleh Mohmedi&#8217;s Instagram page, a plethora of remarkable cartoon characters come to life through the medium of food.
