Pell Grants are a form of federal need-based student aid that doesn\u2019t need to be repaid. They can be used to pay for tuition, books, room and board and more, making them a great avenue for low-income students to attend and graduate from college when they may not otherwise be able to afford to.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"what-is\" data-table-of-contents-category=\"what-is\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/>What is a Federal Pell Grant?<\/h2>\n<p>A Pell Grant is a form of need-based federal student aid available to college students in the United States. Pell Grants can cover all or a portion of qualifying academic expenses, like tuition costs, books, supplies and even personal academic expenses like room and board. Unlike student loans, however, Pell Grants don\u2019t have to be repaid under most circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The federal government created Pell Grants in order to help students with the most amount of financial need. As a result, these grants aren\u2019t always easy to qualify for. However, those who do qualify receive substantial aid that they can use alongside student loans, scholarships and other grants. While Pell Grants aren\u2019t necessarily designed to cover the full cost of attending college, they can certainly help.<\/p>\n<h2 data-beam-element-viewed=\"\" data-id=\"br-h2-second-onpage-placement\" data-type=\"h2\" data-location=\"Loans, Student Loans\" data-name=\"h2_second_placement\" data-position=\"h2_second_placement\" data-text=\"What is a Pell Grant?\" data-outcome=\"\">\n<span id=\"how-much\" data-table-of-contents-category=\"how-much\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/>How much money can I get from the Pell Grant?<\/h2>\n<p>Pell Grants are intended to supplement other forms of financial aid, such as scholarships and student loans. Every year, the U.S. Department of Education sets the maximum amount of each Pell Grant award; for the 2023-24 school year, that amount is $7,395. The grant may be even higher for certain students who had a parent killed in the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. Still, not every student is eligible to receive the full award, and some don\u2019t qualify at all.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you receive in Pell Grant aid will vary based on factors like your expected family contribution (EFC), the cost of your school, whether you attend school full time or part time and your enrollment plans.<\/p>\n<p>Eligible students can receive the Pell Grant each year they\u2019re enrolled, up to 12 terms or roughly six years. Students who enroll for three terms in an academic year may be able to receive up to 150 percent of their scheduled Pell Grant award for that year.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"eligible\" data-table-of-contents-category=\"eligible\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/>Pell Grant eligibility requirements<\/h2>\n<p>Pell Grants are available to many students, but there are certain requirements that you will have to meet in order to be considered eligible. In order to receive a Pell Grant, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a high school diploma or GED<\/li>\n<li>Be enrolled or accepted to enroll in an approved program<\/li>\n<li>Have a valid Social Security number<\/li>\n<li>Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)<\/li>\n<li>Maintain satisfactory status in your schooling<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, you will need to meet at least one of the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a U.S. citizen or U.S. national<\/li>\n<li>Have a green card<\/li>\n<li>Have an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94)<\/li>\n<li>Have battered immigrant status<\/li>\n<li>Have a T-Visa<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As of 2023, the following types of students also qualify for Pell Grants:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students unable to complete studies due to a school closing<\/li>\n<li>Borrowers whose loans were discharged under borrower defense to repayment<\/li>\n<li>Students who are incarcerated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Since eligibility for Pell Grants is based on the expected family contribution amount and not income, there is no specific income cutoff to consider. Your EFC estimates your family\u2019s financial responsibility based on resources like their total assets, yearly income and family size.<\/p>\n<p>However, these grants are geared toward students who experience exceptional financial needs, so those from low-income families are most likely to qualify for the maximum award amount. Other factors, like the school\u2019s cost of attendance (COA), are also factored into your eligibility.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"apply\" data-table-of-contents-category=\"apply\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/>How do I apply for a Pell Grant?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To see if you qualify for a Pell Grant and other financial aid, you\u2019ll start by filling out the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FAFSA). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This form helps schools and government bodies determine how much aid each student is eligible for. The application process is relatively simple and requires submitting your parents\u2019 financial information or your income if you are supporting yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will have to create a Federal Student Aid identification and login to submit your FAFSA. Once you have created your account, enter and submit the necessary information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAFSA must be completed yearly to maintain eligibility for Pell Grants and other financial aid. The application opens each year on Oct. 1 for the upcoming academic year, and it\u2019s best to apply as soon as possible to have your best shot at receiving aid.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"receive\" data-table-of-contents-category=\"receive\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/>How do I receive my Pell Grant?<\/h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, your school will handle your Pell Grant funds, but you might also be paid directly. In some cases, schools will combine these two methods \u2014 most likely, the financial aid office will apply the grant funds to your tuition and fees and send you the remaining funds, if there are any.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Other college funding options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Since Pell Grants can pay a maximum of $7,395 per year in most cases, many students must rely on additional funding to make it through college. Fortunately, there are many options for funding higher education, ranging from student loans, work-study programs, scholarships and other grants.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Pell Grant can get you part of the way there if you\u2019re pursuing an undergraduate degree. If you hope to qualify and feel you may be eligible for this type of aid,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filling out the FAFSA form before the deadline<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the only way to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The bottom line<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grants are available on a first-come, first-served basis for undergraduate students in good standing at their educational institution.
