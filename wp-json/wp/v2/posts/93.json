Her classroom may have emptied for the day, but the final push before A-levels and GCSE exams\u00a0has sent her into \u201cmarking overdrive\u201d. Head of English at a secondary school in Lincolnshire, she has been teaching for almost 30 years and has covered largely the same set texts her entire career, but her enthusiasm for the job \u2013 and the texts \u2013 remains undimmed. As times change and new generations appear, the relevance of the poems, plays and novels doesn\u2019t fade, it evolves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Take today\u2019s lesson on Thomas Hardy\u2019s Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles (1891), which sparked a conversation about victim blaming \u2013 depressingly still a hot topic in 2024. Tess has been raped by Alec, then has a child as a result of this and the child dies. \u201cAt the\u00a0point where Alec comes back,\u201d says\u00a0Atherton, \u201che\u2019s calling Tess a temptress, making his behaviour her fault and her responsibility. The students were really shocked by this.\u201d Literature has the power to invoke empathy in ways news headlines can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Then there\u2019s Robert Browning\u2019s My Last Duchess (1842), a window into toxic masculinity and coercive control that might just sink deeper into developing psyches than a preachy assembly. You would be convinced of this if you were to read chapter one of Atherton\u2019s book, Reading Lessons. It is partly a pleasing romp through the set texts of the nation\u2019s collective youth \u2013 from Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit to JB Priestley\u2019s An Inspector Calls \u2013 exploring why they resonate today. It is also a love letter to the threatened academic subject of English Literature, touchingly threaded throughout with memoir and an exploration of what stories mean to young people.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"dcr-15xdhc\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 22 14\" style=\"fill:var(--pullquote-icon);\" class=\"dcr-scql1j\"><path d=\"M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z\"\/><\/svg><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"dcr-zzndwp\"><p>After austerity and Covid, books can get students to think about how power is used and misused<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">An Inspector Calls (1945), she says, feels more relevant now than at any other time in her career. \u201cAt a time of austerity, the Covid and Post Office inquiries,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s getting students who are at the beginning of their political understanding to think about how power is used and misused. Who are the victims and why are the people wielding the power not more aware of the consequences of what they\u2019re doing?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">The cupboard doors behind Atherton\u2019s desk are neatly decorated with pictures \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Philip Larkin, a Macbeth display, studded with pictures and questions. The trick for engaging children in the themes in the texts, she says, is to start with an isolated line, or imagery. \u201cWith Macbeth, we use something metaphorical like chess pieces. We have to find a way of hooking them, connecting them with a central idea, character or emotion.\u201d If she began by saying they were going to read one of Shakespeare\u2019s most famous tragedies, she\u2019d meet resistance. \u201cWhereas thinking about ambition, fear and that feeling that you\u2019ve done something you can\u2019t undo is something teenagers can connect with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">There are newer additions to the curriculum, including Coram Boy by Jamila Gavin, My Name Is Leon by Kit\u00a0de Waal, \u201cwhich is about a boy growing up in a foster family\u201d, and the\u00a0play Princess and the Hustler by Chinonyerem Odimba, \u201cset around the Bristol bus boycott in the 1960s\u201d. But that doesn\u2019t mean these books will become widely used overnight. \u201cIn terms of resourcing, and at a time when teachers are judged so much on the results that our students get, changing to a completely different set text feels quite frightening. Do I know that this text is going to produce the kind of results that An Inspector Calls does?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">In her chapter on Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, which is set in a similar rural northern setting to where Atherton grew up, she recalls the importance of seeing one\u2019s own world reflected on the page: \u201cIt gives you a sense that your surroundings have a deeper resonance.\u201d Her year nines are reading Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys, an American writer of Lithuanian heritage, \u201cand because we have a lot of students from Lithuanian backgrounds,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s opened up for them conversations with their families, about their own pasts that they hadn\u2019t necessarily thought to ask questions about before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Not that these discussions will win the children points in exams. \u201cWhen I started teaching,\u201d says Atherton, \u201cthere was much more of a sense that we were fostering a relationship with the text, rather than getting students to jump through hoops and meet required assessment objectives.\u201d Now, English Literature and English Language are endangered academic subjects. \u201cA few years ago, we had three students doing A-level English Literature. At that level, courses become unviable.\u201d This was partly down to STEM subjects being heavily pushed in recent years, \u201cand I think increasingly that students go into university thinking about the salary that they\u2019re going to get on graduation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Numbers are climbing again now \u2013 with 15 in the upper sixth doing English Literature \u2013 after a push to highlight how it can inform careers like \u201claw and management, the media and personnel. I\u2019ve got a big wall display out in the corridor featuring a number of our former students who\u2019ve done English at A-level and who are in careers now, where they are using that knowledge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Finding and retaining good teachers is becoming harder, too. \u201cWhen I started, there was a sense that it was a job for life, whereas people now are leaving early, and it is the pressure of workload, the endless accountability. It is a really tough job.\u201d What needs to change? \u201cI think it\u2019s respect for our professional status. A sense that once you\u2019ve been teaching for more than a few years, you are bringing a huge amount of experience of what works and what doesn\u2019t work, and how to handle a class full of teenagers last thing in the day. They are exhausting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">But while parents often worry when their little bookworms are suddenly more interested in their phones and social lives than novels, Atherton believes \u201cthey\u2019re often consuming narrative in other forms\u201d. \u201cWhether that is film, or graphic novels, which are a really big thing for some of our students, and give them really challenging, interesting things to talk about. Things like the Neil Gaiman books that have been adapted into graphic novel form. We have quite a lot of students who read manga.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\" class=\" dcr-173mewl\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\" class=\"dcr-1r8wkpb\">skip past newsletter promotion<\/a><\/p>\n<aside aria-label=\"newsletter promotion\" class=\"dcr-av5vqf\">\n<p class=\"dcr-17vnj8j\">Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Popular topics include politics \u2013 \u201cAt the moment, a lot about the conflict in\u00a0the Middle East, issues around gender and gender politics, or ethnicity, sport,\u00a0computing.\u201d In\u00a0her experience, teenagers can be switched off by the notion that they need to love books. \u201cLet\u2019s think about loving stories instead, the discussion of individuals\u2019 experiences of the world, and the way that different people experience their reality.\u201d Her son gets his stories through films. \u201cHe is not a reader, but he loves narrative and he knows huge amounts about the Vikings, about Batman, and mythos and origin stories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Back in class, Atherton is employing tactics to fight the rise in students thinking: \u201cWhy should I sit down and write something myself when I can get AI to do it for me?\u201d She gives them little creative writing exercises to remind them of the pleasure of finding, \u201cexactly the right word, or the right sentence structure so they think, \u2018I\u2019ve really nailed that.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">Whether it is the simple joy of self-expression, how to answer exam questions or a deeper understanding of toxic masculinity, teaching, says Atherton, is an iterative process. \u201cA poem that we might teach early in year 10, we come back to when they are 18 months older, and more mature and experienced in the world, and they show a much more thoughtful side of themselves. It is about dropping ideas like a pebble and kind of sitting back and having faith that the ripples will be there at some point.\u201d<\/p>\n<footer class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\">\n<p class=\"dcr-hm5hhe\"><span data-dcr-style=\"bullet\"\/> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.guardianbookshop.com\/reading-lessons-9780241629482?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Reading Lessons: The Books We Read at School, the Conversations They Spark and Why They Matter<\/a> by Carol Atherton is published by Fig Tree.<\/p>\n<\/footer>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Carol Atherton is shattered.
