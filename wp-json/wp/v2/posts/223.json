However, it can be a complicated and time-consuming process. Below are some steps to help you get started.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a search engine<\/strong>: Your first action should be to type in your name, nicknames, and online handles into search engines. This step will reveal the information that anyone can easily find on you and can help you plan your next steps, including which companies you may need to contact to have data removed or what accounts to delete.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lock down or delete social media accounts<\/strong>: Deletion is the nuclear option, but most social media platforms will have an option in settings to stop your profile from appearing in search engine results. As our profiles &#8212; even if they are publicly limited &#8212; can contain our photos, full name, and more, removing them from search engine queries can help reduce your online footprint. For step-by-step guides, visit Facebook (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/468080906543413\" class=\"c-regularLink\">here<\/a>), Instagram (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/147542625391305\" class=\"c-regularLink\">here<\/a>), and X &#8212; formerly known as Twitter &#8212; (<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/safety-and-security\/remove-x-profile-from-google-search\" class=\"c-regularLink\">here<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Delete old, unused accounts<\/strong>: Whether shopping, social media, or forums, each service you use &#8212; or have used &#8212; may tie your online identity together through your name, nicknames, or PII, all of which could be at risk if a data breach occurs. If you do not want to use a dedicated service, consider going through your email and password managers to find active accounts. You will need to access them and request removal manually.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clean up forum posts<\/strong>: Forums can often be overlooked, but if someone finds out the handles you commonly use, they may be able to find content connected to you &#8212; which could now be completely irrelevant to the person you are today, or embarrassing if exposed. Delete old forum posts and preferably remove your accounts entirely.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li><strong>Contact webmasters<\/strong>: If you have old accounts that do not have auto-delete features, contact webmasters directly to have your profiles and data deleted. This process will likely be easier if you are in an area covered by regulations such as the EU&#8217;s GDPR.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Request that people finder websites delete your information<\/strong>: People finder websites can be used as &#8216;search engines&#8217; to look up someone based on their name, phone number, and other personal information, which can be a nightmare for privacy. Opting out and forcing the removal of your information from these organizations &#8212; which may buy this information from data brokers &#8212; can be an arduous process to perform manually, as it may require contacting each service individually to negotiate, and could require an understanding of applicable privacy and data protection laws to enforce your requests. Consider using a service such as Incogni or DeleteMe to do the legwork for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deactivate email accounts<\/strong>: Our email accounts tend to be the core platform that ties your digital profile together, but once they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re gone. When you are ready, delete your email accounts, as this will break the common threads between your online services.
