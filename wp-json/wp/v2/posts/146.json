Parents received permission slips to choose how their students would view the solar eclipse on Monday.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Some schools plan to have an eclipse viewing event. Those students would need a signed permission slip to participate in the event.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Schools that are not offering a viewing event are giving parents the option to either pick up their child before or after the eclipse&#8230; or they have the option to keep their child home from school for an excused absence.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\"><b>MORE: <\/b><b>How to prepare for viewing the solar eclipse<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">\u201cI got a 12-year-old and I got this nine-year-old, they\u2019re both going to stay home,\u201d Rennatte Beaufort said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Beaufort said she\u2019s keeping her kids home on Monday as a precaution. She\u2019s also thankful the district gave parents a choice on what to do that day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Megan Whitaker has a 7th and 9th grader enrolled in Duval County schools. She was still weighing her options on Thursday but said she wasn\u2019t planning on keeping them home.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">\u201cI think it\u2019s important they need to go to school. I guess if practices after school are canceled, we\u2019ll decide what to do then. But they\u2019ll go to school, and then we\u2019ll see what to do with them after,\u201d Whitaker said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Whitaker and Beaufort were taking the opportunity to ensure their kids knew about the dangers of looking at the sun during an eclipse.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\"><b>RELATED: <\/b><b>Where to get Eclipse Glasses<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">\u201cI let them know that it\u2019s about the earth rotating and the sun passing each other at one time and kind of give them some inspiration or education of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Beaufort said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">Whitaker said they still own their glasses from a previous eclipse.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">\u201cI thought about maybe even sending them to school with them and maybe sending out the extra glasses we have, maybe to the science teachers and letting them talk about the importance of wearing the glasses with the teachers too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">The permissions slips are due Friday, April 5.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB\">For more information on the eclipse from the school board, visit <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/dcps.duvalschools.org\/\">dcps.duvalschools.org<\/a>.
