The theory was first suggested by Western scholars who believed a race of European or Central Asians displaced the Harappans.<\/p>\n<p>In Chapter 8 of the political science textbook, apart from highlighting the Ram Janmabhoomi movement (and eliminating three mentions of the Babri Masjid) and the Congress&#8217; downturn, the NCERT has included revisions relating to the 1990 Mandal Commission, the economic reforms starting from 1991, and the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.<\/p>\n<p>According to the NCERT, &#8220;content is update per latest development in politics. The text on Ayodhya has been thoroughly revised because of the changes brought by the Supreme Court&#8217;s Constitutional bench verdict (the landmark judgement allotting the land on which the mosque stood to the Hindu petitioners) and its widespread welcoming reception.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Ayodhya issue, and the points mentioned above, have been listed as the five critical recent developments in Indian politics. With relation to the former, the report said there is a four-page section that revises the sequence of events and suggested the communal violence that followed the mosque&#8217;s demolition as being triggered by &#8220;mobilisation by both sides&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In another instance, the NCERT has said the Ayodhya developments &#8220;are associated with the rise of the BJP and the politics of &#8216;Hindutva'&#8221;. In these and other instances, references to the demolition of the Babri Masjid have been removed.<\/p>\n<p>Changes have also been made to the history and sociology books for Class 7 to 10, the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/education\/class-12-history-book-tweaked-harappans-indigenous-no-aryan-clarity-9250070\/\">Indian Express<\/a> said, quoting an NCERT statement, The biggest change, though, is to the Class 12 book, specifically a chapter called &#8216;Bricks, Beads, and Bones &#8211; The Harappan Civilisation&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Indian Express, the changes referencing the Harappans have been introduced due to &#8220;recent evidence from archaeological sites&#8221;, and underline &#8220;unbroken continuity&#8221; of what is also called the Indus Valley Civilisation. At the heart of these changes is &#8220;recent archaeogenic research&#8221; from an excavation site in Haryana&#8217;s Rakhigarhi, which claims the Harappans as &#8220;indigenous&#8221; people.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The DNA of the Harappans has continued till today and a majority of the South Asian population appears to be their descendants,&#8221; the new textbook tells students, and also omits established breaks between early and later Harappan civilisations. It also calls for research into &#8220;the relationship between Harappans and Vedic people&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Also, according to a report by <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/thewire.in\/education\/ncert-history-class-12-sociology-aryan-harappan\">The Wire<\/a>, Class 12 sociology students will now be told that marginalised communities&#8217; struggles were not marked by poverty and social stigma.<\/p>\n<p>These changes will take effect for 2024\/25 and have been communicated to the CBSE, and the changed books &#8211; to be used by around four crore students &#8211; will be available this month.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, this is the fourth time NCERT textbooks have been revised, or amended, since 2014, including a &#8220;rationalization&#8221; exercise &#8211; which saw further contentious deletions &#8211; following the pandemic that the government said was meant to reduce the burden on students.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The NCERT has made five major amendments to Class 12 political science textbooks, dropping references to the demolition of the Babri Masjid and flagging the &#8220;decline&#8221; of the Congress after the 1989 general election, the Indian Express reported this week.
