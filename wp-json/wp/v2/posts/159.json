Mike Dunleavy\u2019s latest education veto and the Legislature\u2019s failure to override it. <\/p>\n<p>The walkout was part of a protest organized by the executive board of the Alaska Association of Student Governments, said Felix Myers, a student organizer from Sitka. Plans called for 40-minute walkouts at schools across Alaska, with 40 representing the number of votes lawmakers needed to override the veto. <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\">Lawmakers fell one vote short<\/span> in their override attempt last month. The walkout was planned for around 11 a.m., a time chosen in part to minimize disruptions and to ensure participation, he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be heard, we\u2019ve tried to be listened to and we\u2019ve been ignored, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gotten to this point,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Anchorage. Myers is a student adviser to the state board of education but said he was not speaking or acting in that capacity concerning the walkout.<\/p>\n<p>Dunleavy in March <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\">made good on a threat<\/span> to veto a package overwhelming passed by lawmakers that called for a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula. He complained the measure lacked provisions he supported, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\">including a three-year program<\/span> offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting those schools. <\/p>\n<p>But those items lacked broad support among lawmakers, who questioned the effectiveness and cost of the untested teacher retention plan and expressed concern that allowing the state education board \u2014 whose members are appointed by the governor \u2014 to directly approve charters would erode local control. <\/p>\n<p>After vetoing the package, Dunleavy said he was moving on to other issues, such as energy, but in a later statement said: \u201cAs the conversation around education continues, I will work with every member of the legislature to pass an increase in funding and needed reforms.\u201d He has not specified what increase in funding he would support.<\/p>\n<p>School leaders and advocates urged a roughly $360 million increase in aid \u2014 but nonetheless supported the package passed by lawmakers as a positive step. <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\">School officials have cited the toll<\/span> of inflation, along with high energy and insurance costs, as they struggle in some cases with multimillion-dollar deficits and teacher shortages.<\/p>\n<p>They also said unpredictable levels of state support make long-term planning difficult. Lawmakers last year approved a one-time, $175-million funding boost but Dunleavy vetoed half that sum. Lawmakers could not muster sufficient support to override that veto, either.<\/p>\n<p>School funding is expected to remain a closely watched issue the remainder of this session.<\/p>\n<p>During the walkout Thursday, students from Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kal\u00e9 and supporters \u2014 including some legislators \u2014 marched roughly a mile to the state Capitol, with some carrying handmade signs and chanting slogans, such as \u201cfund our future.\u201d They chanted loudly in the Capitol halls, including on the third floor, where the governor\u2019s offices are, though Dunleavy was not in Juneau Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>About two dozen students gathered in the House Finance Committee room and after a meeting on an unrelated issue had concluded, approached Republican Rep. Julie Coulombe. She is one of the lawmakers who voted for the education package but voted against overturning Dunleavy\u2019s veto. Coulombe welcomed their questions.<\/p>\n<p>She said given Dunleavy\u2019s opposition to the package, she worried that even if an override were successful he would still wind up cutting at least some of the additional funding for schools when he got the state budget. She said she wants to keep working on a plan that would provide extra funding and get Dunleavy\u2019s support. She encouraged the students to stay involved. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose hope, this is a messy process,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Rachel Wood, a student who marched to the Capitol on Thursday, said the event showed her young people can play an active part in what happens at the Legislature. She and fellow student Meadow Stanley said they hoped lawmakers who expressed support for education back that up by passing increased funding.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script>\n  window.fbAsyncInit = function() {\n      FB.init({<\/p>\n<p>              appId : '870613919693099',<\/p>\n<p>          xfbml : true,\n          version : 'v2.9'\n      });\n  };<\/p>\n<p>  (function(d, s, id){\n     var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n     if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}\n     js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n     js.src = \"\n     fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n   }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n<\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Students in Alaska\u2019s capital walked out of school Thursday and marched through the halls of the statehouse to protest Republican Gov.
