This agency offers a wide range of first-time home buyer loan programs at its own special interest rates.<\/p>\n<p><span>Verify your home buying eligibility in CA. Start here<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To qualify for any of CalHFA\u2019s special mortgage loans, you\u2019ll need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be an eligible first-time home buyer<\/li>\n<li>Complete a home buyer education course<\/li>\n<li>Meet CalHFA\u2019s median income limits<sup>5<\/sup><\/li>\n<li>Have a minimum credit score of 660-680, depending on the program<\/li>\n<li>Purchase a primary residence within the state of California<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>CalHFA offers an eight-hour online home buyer education course for just $99. Participation is mandatory if you want to be eligible for financial help from the agency. And, it facilitates one-on-one counseling sessions for home buyers, which can be face-to-face or virtual. But fees vary depending on the service you choose.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-fha-loan\">CalHFA FHA loan<\/h3>\n<p>The CalHFA FHA loan program is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and features a 30-year mortgage with a fixed interest rate. You can use this loan to purchase a single-family home or approved condominium. <\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calplus-fha-loan\">CalPLUS FHA loan<\/h3>\n<p>The CalPLUS FHA program is another government-backed mortgage that comes with a slightly higher interest rate than its standard FHA loan. However, this home loan is combined with a closing cost assistance program, called the CalHFA Zero Interest Program (ZIP). <\/p>\n<p>Similar to the CalHFA FHA loan, this program features a 30-year mortgage that will finance the purchase of a single-family primary residence.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-va-loan\">CalHFA VA loan<\/h3>\n<p>Eligible veterans and active-duty service members have access to this VA-insured mortgage with a 30-year loan term and fixed-interest rate. The CalHFA VA program can be used to finance the purchase of a single-family home or condo.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-usda-loan\">CalHFA USDA loan<\/h3>\n<p>This 30-year, fixed-rate loan is backed by the USDA and comes with down payment assistance, called the \u201cMyHome Assistance Program.\u201d In addition to CalHFA guidelines, applicants to the CalHFA USDA program must meet both USDA income limits and eligible rural area requirements to qualify.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-conventional-loan\">CalHFA conventional loan<\/h3>\n<p>The CalHFA conventional program is a 30-year mortgage with a fixed interest rate. Like all conventional loans, you\u2019ll have to pay for private mortgage insurance when your down payment is less than 20% of the home purchase price.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calplus-conventional-loan\">CalPLUS conventional loan<\/h3>\n<p>This 30-year, fixed-rate loan comes with a slightly higher mortgage rate than the standard conventional home loan. But the CalPLUS conventional program comes paired with the MyHome and ZIP programs that will cover both your down payment and closing costs.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calvet-home-buyer-program\">CalVet home buyer program<\/h3>\n<p>The CalVet program is open only to veterans, service members, and those in closely associated groups. It says its website \u201cis designed to help you understand the steps to homeownership and discover just how easy and stress-free purchasing a home and securing a CalVet home loan can be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The agency provides special VA loan options that can help veterans who wish to buy homes in the Golden State. You can call CalVet loan originators to check your eligibility at (866) 653-2510 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.).<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-dream-for-all-shared-appreciation-loan\">The Dream For All Shared Appreciation Loan<\/h3>\n<p>The Dream For All Shared Appreciation Loan is a down payment assistance program for first-time homebuyers and provides funding up to 20% of the home\u2019s sales price. It is to be used in conjunction with the Dream For All Conventional first mortgage for down payment and\/or closing costs. <\/p>\n<p>As the program name implies, you will need to repay the original down payment loan plus a share of the appreciation in the value of the home. So for example, if you receive a 20% down payment loan toward your new home, the state housing authority will collect 20% of the increased value when you sell, transfer, or refinance the home. <\/p>\n<p>As with most down payment assistance programs, you\u2019ll need to meet the minimum credit score requirements and stay within the county income limit. You must also complete a homebuyer education course before closing. <\/p>\n<p><span\/><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"california-first-time-home-buyer-grants\">California first-time home buyer grants<\/h2>\n<p>The Golden State has countless down payment assistance programs (DPAs) that can provide financial help toward your down payment and often closing costs.<\/p>\n<p>Some of those are local and serve specific counties or cities. But here are the details of the main statewide programs.<\/p>\n<p><span>Let us help find the right mortgage for you<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-myhome-assistance\">CalHFA MyHome Assistance<\/h3>\n<p>Qualifying home buyers could borrow up to 3.5% toward their down payment and closing costs under the CalHFA MyHome Assistance Program.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify for MyHome down payment assistance, buyers must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a first-time home buyer<\/li>\n<li>Purchase a single-family home<\/li>\n<li>Live in the home as their primary residence<\/li>\n<li>Complete home buyer education counseling<\/li>\n<li>Meet income limits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note, this program previously imposed a $15,000 cap for borrowers, which was <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.calhfa.ca.gov\/homeownership\/bulletins\/2022\/2022-03.pdf\">eliminated in 2022<\/a>, meaning that borrowers can now access the full 15% of their loan amount.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of whether that $15,000 cap applies, you <strong>can&#8217;t<\/strong> borrow more than:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>3.5% of the home purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less, for an FHA loan<\/li>\n<li>3% of the home purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less, for a conventional, VA, or USDA loan<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are loans (a.k.a. \u201csecond mortgages\u201d or \u201cjunior loans\u201d) rather than grants. However, they\u2019re<em> deferred-payment <\/em>loans. That means you don\u2019t have to make monthly payments. Instead, you pay back the whole amount (plus interest) when you move, sell, refinance, or otherwise change the ownership of your home. <\/p>\n<h3 id=\"calhfa-accessible-dwelling-unit-adu-grant-program\">CalHFA Accessible Dwelling Unit (ADU) Grant Program<\/h3>\n<p>As part of the 2023-24 State Budget, $25 million has been allocated to The CalHFA ADU Grant Program. This initiative provides up to $40,000 for pre-development costs and non-reoccurring closing costs to build the ADU.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify for The CalFHA ADU Grant assistance, buyers must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meet income limits <\/li>\n<li>Live in the home as their primary residence<\/li>\n<li>Complete and sign the CalHFA Participant Affidavit<\/li>\n<li>Provide a Certificate of Occupancy upon completion of the ADU<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To build an ADU and take advantage of this new California homeowner grant, reach out to CalHFA-approved mortgage lenders, non-profits, and local government agencies.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"pathway-to-homeownership-closing-cost-assistance\">Pathway to Homeownership Closing Cost Assistance<\/h3>\n<p>The California Association of Realtors\u2019 (C.A.R.) Housing Affordability Fund\u2019s (HAF) Pathway to Homeownership Closing Cost Assistance grant program was established in 2022, with the goal of providing closing cost assistance to eligible first-time California home buyers. Eligible recipients could get up to $10,000 in grant funds to help cover closing costs.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify for the Pathway to Homeownership Closing Cost Assistance grant program, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a first-time home buyer in California<\/li>\n<li>Be a member of a designated <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.car.org\/aboutus\/mediacenter\/newsreleases\/2023-News-Releases\/2023hafclosingcostgrant\">Underserved Community<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Buy a single-family residence<\/li>\n<li>Live in the home as their primary residence<\/li>\n<li>Meet income limits<\/li>\n<li>Be represented by a member of the California Association of Realtors<\/li>\n<li>Be left with no more than $20,000 in savings after the home purchase<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"forgivable-equity-builder-loan\">Forgivable Equity Builder Loan<\/h3>\n<p>The Forgivable Equity Builder Loan is a newer California home buyer program that aims to help first-time homeowners buy property more affordably. Via this program, buyers can get a loan of up to 10% of the purchase price which is forgivable after five years, provided they continue to live in the property full-time during that period.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify for the Forgivable Equity Builder Loan, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a first-time home buyer in California<\/li>\n<li>Buy a single-family, one-unit residence<\/li>\n<li>Live in the home as your primary residence<\/li>\n<li>Complete a home buyer education course if borrowing through CalHFA<\/li>\n<li>Meet county income limits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"california-home-buyer-key-stats\">California home buyer key stats<\/h2>\n<p>The median home sales price in California was $785,600 in February 2024, an increase of 11.4% year-over-year, according to Redfin. California home prices continue to outpace the national average by quite a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the Golden State offers plenty of assistance in the form of home buyer education, special mortgages, and down payment assistance.

And you never have to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, few first-time buyers have saved a 20% down payment. Doing so could be especially challenging in California, where 20% of the average sales price is nearly $160,000.<\/p>\n<p>But the good news is that you don\u2019t need 20% down. Not by a long shot. California home buyers can often get into a new home with as little as 3% or even 0% down using one of these low-down-payment mortgage programs:<\/p>\n<p><span>Find the best first-time home buyer loan for you. Start here<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Conventional 97<\/strong><\/span>: With Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you may qualify with a 3% down payment and 620 minimum credit score. You can usually stop paying private mortgage insurance after a few years<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">FHA loan<\/span><\/strong>: Backed by the Federal Housing Administration, you could qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down and a 580 minimum credit score. But you\u2019re on the hook for mortgage insurance until you refinance to a different type of mortgage, move, or pay off your loan<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">VA loan<\/span><\/strong>: Only for veterans and active-duty service members, the VA mortgage offers a zero-down-payment option. Minimum credit score varies by lender but often 620. There\u2019s no ongoing mortgage insurance after closing. These are arguably the best mortgages available, so apply if you\u2019re eligible<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">USDA loan<\/span><\/strong>: For those on low-to-moderate incomes buying in designated rural areas.

That means you can\u2019t use these loans for a vacation home or investment property.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, most programs let you use gifted money or down payment assistance (DPA) to cover your down payment and closing costs. Depending on the mortgage loan you choose, you could potentially get into your new house with minimal cash out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure which program to choose for your first mortgage, your lender or real estate agent can help you find the right match based on your finances and home buying goals.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"buying-a-home-in-californias-major-cities\">Buying a home in California\u2019s major cities <\/h2>\n<p>California\u2019s big cities are some of the most costly in the nation.

That rose 6% year-over-year.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to buy a home at that median price, your down payment options might fall between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$36,000<\/strong> for 3% down payment<\/li>\n<li><strong>$240,000<\/strong> for 20% down payment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The City of Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA) has a couple of programs that can help first-time buyers. These include the Low Income Purchase Assistance (LIPA) program and the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC).<\/p>\n<p>The LIPA program can provide deferred payment loans of up to $140,000 to low-income borrowers to be applied to the down payment and closing costs. These loans have no monthly payments and are repayable when you move or refinance.<\/p>\n<p>There are similar programs for those buying outside the LA city limits run by the Los Angeles County Development Authority.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"san-diego-first-time-home-buyers\">San Diego first-time home buyers<\/h3>\n<p>The median home listing price in San Diego was $949,900 in February 2024, an annual increase of 1.4%, according to Realtor.com. <\/p>\n<p>If you want to buy a home at that median price, your down payment options might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$28,497<\/strong> for 3% down payment<\/li>\n<li><strong>$189,980<\/strong> for 20% down payment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC) First-Time Homebuyer Program offers access to several types of help, including deferred loans, homeownership grants, and down payment and closing cost assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Via the SDHC, San Diego first-time home buyers might be eligible for down payment or closing cost assistance up to $10,000 or 4% of the home purchase price, whichever is less. The city even offers a deferred-payment assistance loan of up to 22% of the purchase price. <\/p>\n<p><span>Let us help find the right mortgage for your first home in San Diego.

That decreased 8.3% year-over-year.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to buy a home at that median price, your down payment options could range between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$36,000<\/strong> for 3% down payment<\/li>\n<li><strong>$240,000<\/strong> for 20% down payment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Housing Trust Silicon Valley has a program called Empower Homebuyers SCC, which can lend you up to 30% of your next home\u2019s appraised value (with strings).<\/p>\n<p>This is another deferred loan, meaning you make no monthly payments but have to pay the whole amount back \u201cwhen the loan matures, you decide to sell, or you refinance your mortgage.\u201d This is also an equity-sharing program, meaning the Housing Trust will be entitled to a share of the equity you build in your home. <\/p>\n<p>The website explains:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou will share your appreciation in equal proportion to the amount you borrowed. This means if your loan was 30% of the purchase price, you will share 30% of the appreciation and the rest of the equity that builds up on your home over time is yours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor instance, if you buy a house for $600,000 and use Empower to borrow 20% ($120,000) for the down payment, and the home is later sold for $800,000, you would owe a total of $160,000 (the original loan amount of $120,000, plus $40,000\/20% of the $200,000 appreciation).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you have to have 3% of the purchase price saved to benefit. But then you can put down 20%, which should get you a low mortgage rate and save you from paying any form of mortgage insurance.<\/p>\n<p>If your income is too high for that program, the Homebuyer Empowerment Loan Program (HELP) is an alternative, also run by Housing Trust Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-find-home-buying-help-in-california\">Where to find home buying help in California<\/h2>\n<p>All the organizations we\u2019ve listed above should provide advice freely to any first-time home buyer in the state of California.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to our selection, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides access to a few lists of statewide, regional, and local resources.<\/p>\n<p><span>Verify your home buying eligibility in CA.
