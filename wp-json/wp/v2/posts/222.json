So in charging for AI search Google will be seeking to at least recoup these costs,\u201d said Heather Dawe, chief data scientist at the digital transformation consultancy UST.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">Much of the focus within AI is on the huge expense of the computing power used to train cutting-edge generative models. In the last year Amazon ran a single training run that cost $65m (\u00a351m), <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/perspectives.mvdirona.com\/2024\/01\/cidr-2024\/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">according to James Hamilton<\/a>, <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/perspectives.mvdirona.com\/2024\/01\/cidr-2024\/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">an engineer<\/a>, who expects, in the near future, the company to break the $1bn mark.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">Last week, OpenAI and Microsoft <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/microsoft-openai-planning-100-billion-data-center-project-information-reports-2024-03-29\/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">announced plans<\/a> to build a $100bn datacentre for AI training, while in January <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/01\/18\/mark-zuckerberg-indicates-meta-is-spending-billions-on-nvidia-ai-chips.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Mark Zuckerberg said his goal<\/a> was to spend at least $9bn just on Nvidia GPUs alone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">But the cost of training AI is just a tenth of the total cost of the sector, according to the analyst Brent Thill at the investment firm Jefferies. Thill wrote in a briefing note: \u201cThe majority of AI compute spend today is directed to the running, not training, of models, and 90%+ of AI compute spend today is being directed towards inferencing [the process by which an AI model is queried], as inferencing spend has been growing much faster than training as more models and tools get put into production.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">He added: \u201cSome have priced new Gen AI features at a monthly rate, betting that higher charges will cover usage expenses, while others have priced on a per-usage basis to protect themselves on the cost-side. Some have also incorporated into existing plans, hoping to drive [user] growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">Competitors in AI search offer similar subscription plans. <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.perplexity.ai\/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Perplexity<\/a>, an AI-powered search engine, runs no adverts but offers a $20 monthly \u201cpro\u201d tier that provides access to more powerful AI models and unlimited use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dcr-4cudl2\">Others, though, continue to offer their products at a loss. The AI features in Microsoft\u2019s Bing are free to use but tied to the company\u2019s Edge browser. The browsing and search startup Arc offers its products free to users and says it intends to raise revenue in future by charging companies for business features.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google is reportedly drawing up plans to charge for AI-enhanced search features, in what would be the biggest shake-up to the company\u2019s revenue model in its history.
